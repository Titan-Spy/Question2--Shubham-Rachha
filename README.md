Code Explanation

This code is a loop that iterates over a range of numbers based on the input given by the user. For each iteration, it reads two integers n and k, then reads a list of n integers H. It initializes a counter c to 0 and iterates over the list H. For each element in H, if the element is greater than k, it increments the counter c. After iterating over all elements in H, it prints the final value of c, which represents the count of elements greater than k in the list H. This process is repeated for each iteration of the loop, printing the count for each test case.
